# week-one-challenge

The end challenge for Modole 1 was to refactor a landing page to meet accessibility standards and improve search engine optimisation.

## Changelog
### HTML
- Updated all heading tags to follow logical order
- Changed div elements to semantic HTML elements were available
- Added alt text to images for the webpage

### CSS
- Refactored styles to create the main page
- Updated header styling in the footer
- Updated styles for the page header
- Condensed code for styles across the page

## Learning
I have learnt many terms for semantic elements used in HTML pages. I can confidently create a basic HTML page with several elements in it. I can link this page to a style sheet and use CSS styles for my layout and appearance.
